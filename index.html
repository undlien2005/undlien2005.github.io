        <p>This summer vacation I was at the cabin, we have a decent-sized cabin, where my cousins own the cabin beside, we used to own the cabin before, but I thought it was boring staying at the hut alone, so he gave away one of the cabins to my cousins.<br> so this summer we fished, bathed, were at a concert, played cards, had the best food, and enjoyed the wonderful weather</p>

        <p>Loen is a place in norway, a beautiful place in norway. <br> I visited Loen with my parents, grandparents and my cousin, it was a lot of hotels, activities and restaurants there. <br> <br>I climbed Loen via ferreta, with my parents and my cousin, it was fun, we had to walk over a bridge over two mountains, and a little balance rope, that was insanly scary, but we did it. When the trip was over i went and bought a Loen shirt.</p>
